How do you get started on this? Do you read published literature? Medium articles? Ask your senior? Just know off the top of your head? \\n\\nAs someone early in their career I would like to know how to find the generally accepted approach of trying to solve a problem that has been solved before.  \n","2    I am the only analyst working at my job which is the center of a consortium, with a lot of different audiences demanding information. In the last few months, my job was pushed to launch a new program without having everything fully ready to go yet. Now, we are in a situation where our main database is going through weekly changes while people are collecting data, with little documentation on what actually means what. It's being built as we're using it, to the frustration of everyone, but especially me because it turns a 10 minute pull into a 2 hour one while I have to go hunt down what things actually mean what.\\n\\nThere are last minute data requests from people who don't even fully know what data they're asking for, people who want involved analyses within two days, etc, all while our database is changing constantly. Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification. And he wanted it almost immediately so he'd have a talking point for a speech.\\n\\nA lot of them are either ignoring the dashboards that can give them the info they look for, or aren't allowed to have direct access in the first place because my org is strict with who can access what. I can't leave this job until June, but what methods can I use to get control of these requests, or what data policies can I advocate for with my higher-ups, because they don't know anything about tech or data. At this point, I'm going to either ignore silly requests, tell them to go look at the dashboards, or tell people they'll have to wait to receive it.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I have a degree in the Arts field.

Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?\\n\\nIs it generally the case that models are built in areas where you can in fact get some sort of automated and periodically new set of labels?\\n\\nWhen I interned at big tech, we labeled a certain search query as type A because the user clicked through and clicked a button that is a strong signal for type A actions. Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A\\n\\nAny help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated  \n","164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Let’s say that you launch an offline ad in one city but there is no control group. \\n\\nI’ve read about a few techniques:\\n\\nBSTS\\nTime Based Regression\\nSynthetic control \\nPanel data\\n\\nHow would you go about picking which technique to use?  \n","165                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Hey all,I have done my bachelors in IT and worked as a developer for 1.7 years and now decided to get into the field of data science.I'm gearing up to pursue a master's degree in data science in just five months, and I'm eager to dive into some foundational courses to prepare myself.

Now, we are in a situation where our main database is going through weekly changes while people are collecting data, with little documentation on what actually means what. It's being built as we're using it, to the frustration of everyone, but especially me because it turns a 10 minute pull into a 2 hour one while I have to go hunt down what things actually mean what.\\n\\nThere are last minute data requests from people who don't even fully know what data they're asking for, people who want involved analyses within two days, etc, all while our database is changing constantly. Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification. And he wanted it almost immediately so he'd have a talking point for a speech.\\n\\nA lot of them are either ignoring the dashboards that can give them the info they look for, or aren't allowed to have direct access in the first place because my org is strict with who can access what. I can't leave this job until June, but what methods can I use to get control of these requests, or what data policies can I advocate for with my higher-ups, because they don't know anything about tech or data. At this point, I'm going to either ignore silly requests, tell them to go look at the dashboards, or tell people they'll have to wait to receive it.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Analysts with Weird Degrees: What is it?</td>\n","      <td>94</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1b2n9ib/analysts_with_weird_degrees_what_is_it/</td>\n","      <td>91</td>\n","      <td>I have a degree in the Arts field.

Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A\\n\\nAny help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>164</th>\n","      <td>How would you measure the impact of a offline ad without a control group</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1alw1c9/how_would_you_measure_the_impact_of_a_offline_ad/</td>\n","      <td>13</td>\n","      <td>Let’s say that you launch an offline ad in one city but there is no control group. \\n\\nI’ve read about a few techniques:\\n\\nBSTS\\nTime Based Regression\\nSynthetic control \\nPanel data\\n\\nHow would you go about picking which technique to use?</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>165</th>\n","      <td>Beginning my data science journey!</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1am4dvs/beginning_my_data_science_journey/</td>\n","      <td>19</td>\n","      <td>Hey all,I have done my bachelors in IT and worked as a developer for 1.7 years and now decided to get into the field of data science.I'm gearing up to pursue a master's degree in data science in just five months, and I'm eager to dive into some foundational courses to prepare myself.

I now work for a large consulting firm. Management consistently uses the term \\\"hands on keys\\\".\\n\\nI obviously know what it means, but it drives me bonkers! It seems to me to have the connotation that managers/directors are above rolling up their sleeves to perform code reviews, set up cloud architecture, and help junior staff with development, when necessary.\\n\\nWe're a small division, hence why joined, so I believe mid-level management should be more in the weeds. Also, I understand that the mid-level managers, who couldn't directly contribute, were the ones who were laid off during the 2023 Tech RIFFs.\\n\\nThis term and mentality seem to correlate with people who have the \\\"offshore first\\\" mindset.

I'd describe myself as an exceptional data engineer, and an average, but enthusiastically improving data scientist. To that end, I'm also in school working through a graduate program in data science (50% done). \\n\\nMy issue is that the better I get (at least on paper), the more people seem to criticize my analysis. There's many analysts at my office, but very few legitimate data science positions and I've had more than one good friend tell me that my analysis was too hard to understand. This always hits hard because I work very hard to be fair, honest, and understandable.\\n\\nI honestly don't know if I'm being needlessly complex (to show off), if I'm bad at explaining my analysis, or if I'm just talking in the wrong way to the wrong people. I will say that it absolutely could be an ego issue because I do often feel a strong need to differentiate myself from the growing BI community. \\n\\nIs this a common feeling/experience for new data scientists?  For those of you that are more experienced, when you are asked to analyze data for general consumption (for non engineers), do you dumb everything down and leave out the checks and validation that give you confidence in your answers? \\n\\nIf you are curious, this is probably a [decently representative project that I did for school](https://default.qc0qma7a4qq1g.us-east-2.cs.amazonlightsail.com/results).

How do you get started on this? Do you read published literature? Medium articles? Ask your senior? Just know off the top of your head? \\n\\nAs someone early in their career I would like to know how to find the generally accepted approach of trying to solve a problem that has been solved before.  \n","2    I am the only analyst working at my job which is the center of a consortium, with a lot of different audiences demanding information. In the last few months, my job was pushed to launch a new program without having everything fully ready to go yet. Now, we are in a situation where our main database is going through weekly changes while people are collecting data, with little documentation on what actually means what. It's being built as we're using it, to the frustration of everyone, but especially me because it turns a 10 minute pull into a 2 hour one while I have to go hunt down what things actually mean what.\\n\\nThere are last minute data requests from people who don't even fully know what data they're asking for, people who want involved analyses within two days, etc, all while our database is changing constantly. Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification. And he wanted it almost immediately so he'd have a talking point for a speech.\\n\\nA lot of them are either ignoring the dashboards that can give them the info they look for, or aren't allowed to have direct access in the first place because my org is strict with who can access what. I can't leave this job until June, but what methods can I use to get control of these requests, or what data policies can I advocate for with my higher-ups, because they don't know anything about tech or data. At this point, I'm going to either ignore silly requests, tell them to go look at the dashboards, or tell people they'll have to wait to receive it.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I have a degree in the Arts field.

They’re big on monitoring models and engineering as well\\n\\nOther than tracking distributional shifts in the features, how does model monitoring work for classifiers and regressors? \\n\\nI ask because in order to know a model is performing worse, you need new labels right? Like how would I know the precision or AUC ROC or AUC PR or RMSE is declining for a model in production unless new labels are in the pipeline and the model runs inference on newly labeled data?\\n\\nIs it generally the case that models are built in areas where you can in fact get some sort of automated and periodically new set of labels?\\n\\nWhen I interned at big tech, we labeled a certain search query as type A because the user clicked through and clicked a button that is a strong signal for type A actions. Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A\\n\\nAny help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated  \n","163                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Let’s say that you launch an offline ad in one city but there is no control group. \\n\\nI’ve read about a few techniques:\\n\\nBSTS\\nTime Based Regression\\nSynthetic control \\nPanel data\\n\\nHow would you go about picking which technique to use?  \n","164                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Hey all,I have done my bachelors in IT and worked as a developer for 1.7 years and now decided to get into the field of data science.I'm gearing up to pursue a master's degree in data science in just five months, and I'm eager to dive into some foundational courses to prepare myself.

Now, we are in a situation where our main database is going through weekly changes while people are collecting data, with little documentation on what actually means what. It's being built as we're using it, to the frustration of everyone, but especially me because it turns a 10 minute pull into a 2 hour one while I have to go hunt down what things actually mean what.\\n\\nThere are last minute data requests from people who don't even fully know what data they're asking for, people who want involved analyses within two days, etc, all while our database is changing constantly. Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification. And he wanted it almost immediately so he'd have a talking point for a speech.\\n\\nA lot of them are either ignoring the dashboards that can give them the info they look for, or aren't allowed to have direct access in the first place because my org is strict with who can access what. I can't leave this job until June, but what methods can I use to get control of these requests, or what data policies can I advocate for with my higher-ups, because they don't know anything about tech or data. At this point, I'm going to either ignore silly requests, tell them to go look at the dashboards, or tell people they'll have to wait to receive it.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Analysts with Weird Degrees: What is it?</td>\n","      <td>89</td>\n","      <td>90</td>\n","      <td>I have a degree in the Arts field.

Basically we had a decent signal to label some queries in a somewhat automated way. Not all queries that were Type A were followed through with that button click though. Which is why I guess we built a model to try to generalize queries into Type A or not, even when no button clicking followed — we just had a set of queries where we were confident represented the positive class and marked everything else as not Type A\\n\\nAny help here on how people generally label data and think about model monitoring in classical ML would be greatly appreciated</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>163</th>\n","      <td>How would you measure the impact of a offline ad without a control group</td>\n","      <td>10</td>\n","      <td>13</td>\n","      <td>Let’s say that you launch an offline ad in one city but there is no control group. \\n\\nI’ve read about a few techniques:\\n\\nBSTS\\nTime Based Regression\\nSynthetic control \\nPanel data\\n\\nHow would you go about picking which technique to use?</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>164</th>\n","      <td>Beginning my data science journey!</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>19</td>\n","      <td>Hey all,I have done my bachelors in IT and worked as a developer for 1.7 years and now decided to get into the field of data science.I'm gearing up to pursue a master's degree in data science in just five months, and I'm eager to dive into some foundational courses to prepare myself.

How do you get started on this? Do you read published literature? Medium articles? Ask your senior? Just know off the top of your head? \\n\\nAs someone early in their career I would like to know how to find the generally accepted approach of trying to solve a problem that has been solved before.  \n","2   I am the only analyst working at my job which is the center of a consortium, with a lot of different audiences demanding information. In the last few months, my job was pushed to launch a new program without having everything fully ready to go yet. Now, we are in a situation where our main database is going through weekly changes while people are collecting data, with little documentation on what actually means what. It's being built as we're using it, to the frustration of everyone, but especially me because it turns a 10 minute pull into a 2 hour one while I have to go hunt down what things actually mean what.\\n\\nThere are last minute data requests from people who don't even fully know what data they're asking for, people who want involved analyses within two days, etc, all while our database is changing constantly. Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification. And he wanted it almost immediately so he'd have a talking point for a speech.\\n\\nA lot of them are either ignoring the dashboards that can give them the info they look for, or aren't allowed to have direct access in the first place because my org is strict with who can access what. I can't leave this job until June, but what methods can I use to get control of these requests, or what data policies can I advocate for with my higher-ups, because they don't know anything about tech or data. At this point, I'm going to either ignore silly requests, tell them to go look at the dashboards, or tell people they'll have to wait to receive it.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   I have a degree in the Arts field.

Someone from our board recently asked for numbers of \"top 10 states\" but gave no specification. Top 10 what? When asked, all he replied with was \"I'd be interested in absolute numbers and per capita numbers\" and still no specification.

As mentioned in the first thread, it should not be longer than 90 sec per person, in some of the companies it is called stand-up meeting and it is done literally while standing in order to make it quick.\\n\\nHowever, I still have a few problems with it. Some context - I am a team lead in a mainly remote position.\\n\\nOur head of the department treats it as a place to mingle and get updated with everyone, that is, a mixture between a professional meeting and a social event. It usually makes this meeting being 25-30 minutes.\\n\\nIt seems that the team members join only because they must. They don't participate in a conversation, they don't exchange ideas, and basically just wait for the meeting to end. My head of the department, on the other side, is a big talker, and usually at the end of the daily starts with a five-seven minutes monologue about what he is going to do, what he did, and usually it is the same stuff that he already went over yesterday.\\n\\nMoreover, and sorry in advance for my French, it is the first meeting in the morning, so after one has their coffee and would prefer a silent morning/a meeting with the toilet, we have to nod for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLastly, and most importantly, things in DS are moving slowly. Not everyday we have things to update about. I have meetings with my team members every two days, which are profound, we brainstorm and derive tasks. This is the place where I track their progress and give them feedback. I don't need to see them every day (unless they need me).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n          \"And if yes, where does one find the commonly accepted approaches?\\n\\nFor context, say you are asked to solve a churn problem. How do you get started on this? Do you read published literature? Medium articles? Ask your senior? Just know off the top of your head? \\n\\nAs someone early in their career I would like to know how to find the generally accepted approach of trying to solve a problem that has been solved before.\",\n          \"With a BS + MS in Statistics I don\\u2019t really have any plans to do a PhD. I am more interested in solving problems in the industry than in academia. However, part of me feels \\u201cweird\\u201d that my education is gonna stop at 24 and I will be working and not getting another degree. But that\\u2019s besides the point. My real concern is whether I need to plan on getting some kind of \\u201cprofessional\\u201d degree after my MS in Stats. When I interviewed for a role the hiring manager (who had no background in anything stem) told me I should consider an MBA to round myself out. Frankly I have no interest in doing an MBA. I\\u2019ve gone debt free for my education my whole life (thank you parents for bachelors, and thank you to myself for getting funding for my masters), but in no way do I want to pay for an MBA. \\n\\nFrom my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position. Cause ultimately people hire people and if the directors or c suites have MBAs they know if they have an MBA from xyz university then they are gonna get hired cause of it. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think, is education after my MS in stats necessary? I mean for me \\u201ceducation\\u201d post Masters degree is just reading advanced stats textbooks on my own for fun, whether I need to learn something for work or I\\u2019m just studying it for my enjoyment. But is a formal \\u201cdegree\\u201d required? Like I don\\u2019t really see the point in me doing a PhD in stats, because I just don\\u2019t want to work in an academic setting and frankly I just want money more. \\n\\nIs there a natural cap with a MS in something technical (stats) for example?\\n\\n\\nEdit: I have the offer and I am gonna be working for them.

Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.\\n\\nBut if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).\\n\\nI am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).\\n\\nBecause all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.\\n\\nSo recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.\\n\\ntldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.  \n","142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Jupyter Notebook is one of the most used IDE for data analysis.

I understand that the areas that have the least amount of data are where the most improvements can be made but there are limitations to what I can feasibly do.  \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           I have a degree in the Arts field.

I wanted to break into data science, and so it being lock down and nothing else for me to do, I started teaching myself the cutting edge of the field at the time, things like neural nets and a bunch of advanced ML techniques.

Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.\\n\\nBut if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).\\n\\nI am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).\\n\\nBecause all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.\\n\\nSo recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.\\n\\ntldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>142</th>\n","      <td>What IDE you use for data analysis?</td>\n","      <td>140</td>\n","      <td>173</td>\n","      <td>Jupyter Notebook is one of the most used IDE for data analysis.

Glassdoor, Indeed, Payscale and Salary.com all have a degree of variance, and it also depends on what *kind* of analyst you are.\\n\\nI am:\\n\\n-Risk Analyst L1, Financial Services industry\\n\\n-Coming up to 2 YoE\\n\\n-Total current comp $66,500 a year\\n\\n-MCoL city, USA\\n\\n\\nPersonally, very curious to hear from any Data, Risk and Credit Risk analysts out there!   \n","115  First of all, this is from the perspective of an analyst who is more on the business side, so let me know if I'm completely stupid.\\n\\nWhy I'm writing this - I think many people underestimate the basic \"boring\" math and they just go right to how neural networks function or how to use logistic regression\\n\\nAlgorithms keep changing, libraries keep changing, domain related knowledge will (partially) change as your economy sector evolves and you'll pick it up as you go anyway...\\n\\nEven whatever university degree you pick is kind of arbitrary, some of them might make learning math easier for you, but you can always pick it up yourself - even if you study something seemingly unrelated, if you're smart enough for data science you can self-study math\\n\\nIf you're worried about long-term job prospects and satisfaction, it seems to me you should focus on making your main goal to master all possible areas of math. Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.\\n\\nBut if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example. It will also be easier to pick up the logic behind certain principles within your domain, as you'll get better intuition. Part of this should be learning logic (whether you count this as math or philosophy is up to debate).\\n\\nI am just thinking out loud and kind of looking for confirmation bias, because I've been learning all the juicy ML algorithms and libraries, programming languages etc in the past few years. And I'm thinking I should have just focused on getting better at statistics, probability, combinatorics, discrete math in general... linear algebra... calculus... hell, even if you go all the way back to elementary school or high school, there are surely some topics you forgot and they might be useful to re-learn (like some stuff from geometry that you NEVER used but it could be the missing piece from understanding some stuff you're working on now).\\n\\nBecause all the stuff I learned a few years ago is already obsolete anyway. But math is unchanged for hundreds and thousands of years. And still useful.\\n\\nSo recently I've more shifted to the theoretical side of things. And it's made me happier with problem solving and I have less impostor syndrome. All kinds of different word problems are good practice especially.\\n\\ntldr: Instead of learning 50 ways to do similar things, learning the underlying math - not superficially, but all the way to the fundamentals, even all the way to elementary school if you forgot something - should be better for long-term.   \n","142                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Jupyter Notebook is one of the most used IDE for data analysis.

Even the ones directly unrelated to your work. Because data science (and tech in general) is a lifelong study and you will keep having to learn new stuff all the time.\\n\\nBut if you know the fundamental math behind it all, it will make it much easier to learn new algorithms for example.

As mentioned in the first thread, it should not be longer than 90 sec per person, in some of the companies it is called stand-up meeting and it is done literally while standing in order to make it quick.\\n\\nHowever, I still have a few problems with it. Some context - I am a team lead in a mainly remote position.\\n\\nOur head of the department treats it as a place to mingle and get updated with everyone, that is, a mixture between a professional meeting and a social event. It usually makes this meeting being 25-30 minutes.\\n\\nIt seems that the team members join only because they must. They don't participate in a conversation, they don't exchange ideas, and basically just wait for the meeting to end. My head of the department, on the other side, is a big talker, and usually at the end of the daily starts with a five-seven minutes monologue about what he is going to do, what he did, and usually it is the same stuff that he already went over yesterday.\\n\\nMoreover, and sorry in advance for my French, it is the first meeting in the morning, so after one has their coffee and would prefer a silent morning/a meeting with the toilet, we have to nod for 30 minutes.\\n\\nLastly, and most importantly, things in DS are moving slowly. Not everyday we have things to update about. I have meetings with my team members every two days, which are profound, we brainstorm and derive tasks. This is the place where I track their progress and give them feedback. I don't need to see them every day (unless they need me).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would like to ask my manager (head of) to make the daily meetings actually twice/three times a week, and instead, I will brief him myself, on 1on1, even on a daily for just the management.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n          \"Anyone qualified for this would obviously be offered at least 4x the salary in the US. Can anyone tell me one reason why someone would take this job?\",\n          \"With a BS + MS in Statistics I don\\u2019t really have any plans to do a PhD. I am more interested in solving problems in the industry than in academia. However, part of me feels \\u201cweird\\u201d that my education is gonna stop at 24 and I will be working and not getting another degree. But that\\u2019s besides the point. My real concern is whether I need to plan on getting some kind of \\u201cprofessional\\u201d degree after my MS in Stats. When I interviewed for a role the hiring manager (who had no background in anything stem) told me I should consider an MBA to round myself out. Frankly I have no interest in doing an MBA. I\\u2019ve gone debt free for my education my whole life (thank you parents for bachelors, and thank you to myself for getting funding for my masters), but in no way do I want to pay for an MBA. \\n\\nFrom my limited experience it feels like MBAs are just degrees people get to prove to a higher up that they have the credential to get a c suite position. Cause ultimately people hire people and if the directors or c suites have MBAs they know if they have an MBA from xyz university then they are gonna get hired cause of it. \\n\\nWhat do you guys think, is education after my MS in stats necessary? I mean for me \\u201ceducation\\u201d post Masters degree is just reading advanced stats textbooks on my own for fun, whether I need to learn something for work or I\\u2019m just studying it for my enjoyment. But is a formal \\u201cdegree\\u201d required? Like I don\\u2019t really see the point in me doing a PhD in stats, because I just don\\u2019t want to work in an academic setting and frankly I just want money more. \\n\\nIs there a natural cap with a MS in something technical (stats) for example?\\n\\n\\nEdit: I have the offer and I am gonna be working for them.
